Popup Popups

== Description ==

Create stunning pop-ups in a breeze!

This plugin allows you (in combination with MyPopUps.com) to place cool-looking pop-ups on your site for various purposes:

- Collect emails
- Show discount codes
- Get social likes & shares
- Show cookie notices
- Block ad-blockers

You can design the pop-ups to your liking thanks to the powerful builder on MyPopUps.

You can activate & disable the pop-ups directly inside this plugin (without having to leave your WP dashboard)!

Coming soon: define much more granular rules when & how the pop-ups should show (using WordPress parameters, inside this plugin).

Give it a shot! If you find any ways how to improve it, please let us know in the support forum, we'll always try to respond quickly :)

Note: This plugin relies on the 3rd party service MyPopUps, which can be reached at https://mypopups.com. The pop-ups are created on MyPopUps and displayed on your website with the help of this plugin. Only when you click on the "Yes" button in the plugin a connection is established to MyPopUps (this is also mentioned on that button). For the confidential handling of your data, please have a look at MyPopUps' GDPR-compliant privacy policy at https://mypopups.com/privacy as well at the terms of use at https://mypopups.com/terms. If you have any questions about those, please don't hesitate to contact us here https://mypopups.com/contact-us. Thank you!
